# CodeSnippets
Various scripts and code elements we have created in order to perform our operational duties.

Much of the code here was adapted from things we found around the web for internal use.  This was compiled in a local folder for some time, and only recently was the decision to made to share the work.  As the sources for this material are practically unresolveable, we are opting to NOT publish this under any specific license as it's possible the source is provided under a license that could be conflicting.  Going forward we will take effort to cite any code sources, and if a source for any of our scripts is identified we will be happy to provide attribution and properly adapt any licenses as required.
